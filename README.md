# TaxiManagement
Taxi Management is a C# Assignment completed for my Software Development Module in Year 1. I was given a UML Class Diagram, as well as 100 tests to make pass. In the end, a system to manage taxis using a CLI is created. Including having a Taxi join a rank, Taxi leaves rank, Taxi drops a fare, View financial report, View transaction log, and View taxi locations.
